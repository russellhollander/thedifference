## Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

Of the many religions in the world, ancient as well as modern, the religion of the Bible is the only true one.

Acts 17, 29. 30:  "Forasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.  And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent."

John 17, 3:  "And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent."  (John 3, 18; 1 Cor. 8, 4; Ex. 20, 3-6.)

"Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the true Christian faith.  Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly." -- _Athanasian Creed_.

1.  Carnal mind is in enmity against God.  (Rom. 8, 7.)  Hence man's unwillingness to be governed by Him.  He tries to forgetHim, deny Him; but all to no purpose,-- except, perhaps, for a time.  But the devil is always trying some method whereby he may rob man of the Word of God, so that he shall not believe and be saved.  (Luke 8, 12.)  And one way of accomplishing this is to make him believe that one religion is as good as another, or that Christians "will not be alone about inheriting heaven."

The Swiss reformer Zwingli believed "that all the ancient noble heathens who walked uprightly according to the light they had were also saved."  (_Expos_. _Fidei_, II, 559.)

The Quaker Barclay, in his _Apology_ (10, 2), voices the same thought as regards heathen, Turks, and Jews at the present time.

Acts 4, 12:  "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved."  (See Gospel of St. John.)

1 Cor. 1, 21:  "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."  (2 Thess. 1, 7-10:  "punishment for all who do not know and obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.")

2 Thess. 2, 10-12:  "Because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, ... God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth."

John 14, 6:  "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me."

Christ warned against being an "unbeliever, a heathen and a publican."  (Matt. 18, 17; Mark 16, 17.)

2.  A large class of unbelievers call themselves agnostics.  This sounds better than atheists and freethinkers, but they are in reality their triplet brother.  The "believ" of the agnostic is "We do not know whether there is a God."  ("The problem of existence has not been solved, and it is insoluble":  (Thomas Huxley.)  This dictum has been applied, not only to human existence, but to God Himself, as well as to His revelation.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}

John 1, 14:  "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."

1 John 1, 1. 3:  "That which was from the beginning, which we have seen which we have heard, ... declare we unto you."

2 Pet. 1, 16:  "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eye-witnesses of His majesty."  (See vv. 17. 18.)

Rom. 1, 19:  "even the heathen acknowledge the existence of God.

_What Is an Atheist?_ -- A snare to the simple-minded Christian is the oft repeated assertion that so and so was no atheist, because he had confessed his belief in a personal God or, perhaps, in "a Higher Power."  It is true, the words of the Psalmist (14, 1), "The fool saith in his heart, There is no God," describe more nearly the person called "atheist."  But all who do not confess the true God are properly to be classed as having no God at all.  Christ says:  "He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father."  (John 5, 23.)  "Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven."  (Matt. 10, 33.)  And the Holy Spirit testifies:  "Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father."  (1 John 2, 23.  Compare also 2 John, v. 9.)

_Lodge Religion_. -- Under this head must be ranged all lodges which require a "belief in a Supreme Being" from their members, but who do not define this "Being" as the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and studiously avoid using the name of Jesus in their so-called prayers.  Silently (and here intentionally) to omit a confession of the Savior is to deny Him, and be classed as heathen.  (Matt. 18, 17.)  And Christ explicitly teaches that He is the Way, the Life, and the Truth, and that no man cometh unto the Father but by Him.  (John 14, 6.)

_Evolution_. -- The notion is also prevalent that Christianity, revealed religion, "is subject to the laws of evolution."  Aside from the fact that "the laws of evolution" are only imaginings of depraved human nature, which fain would escape just punishment at the hands of God, "progressive Christianity" is simply an absurdity.  What of a Christianity in which the life, teachings, and deeds of a Christ Jesus, little by little, should be superseded by -- what?  Can you think of a moral law which could supersede the Ten Commandments?  Of a just God more righteous than Jehovah?  more loving than Jesus?  more merciful than He who sent His only-begotten Son as the Savior for the whole world?  more merciful than He who embraces the Prodigal (Luke 15, 20), pardons the adulteress (John 8, 11), promises heaven to the thief on the cross (Luke 29, 43), and prayed even for His enemies?

No doubt, it is considered the height of wisdom at the present time to assert that "the law of evolution" also underlies the Christian religion. But what does history tell us concerning those who have come under its spell?  Heathenism is nothing but the result of a trial to improve on the revelation and government of God.  The Babylonian captivity of the Jews and the final dispersement of them over all the earth is the outcome of a similar experiment.  The early Christian Churches in Asia and elsewhere tried their hands at the same thing, and were rewarded by -- Mohammedanism.  And what is popery, Jesuitism, rationalism but the outcome of efforts to apply "the law of evolution" to religion!  Evolution, indeed, but _always_ an evolution downward.

Though the theory on which Darwinian evolution rests has been discarded as insufficient by conscientious scientists, yet the reechoing of it is still heard in some of our higher institutions of learning, not to mention our normal schools, where our common-school teachers are trained.  Hence we often read of this or that "professor," in our daily papers, who adjudges the remains of some prehistoric (?) animal as being so or so many millions of years old.  These opinions finally find their way into text-books and are henceforth promulgated as "gospel truths."  But what reliance may be put upon them the following well-supported facts will show.

1.  The Neanderthal Skull, has, since 1856, been offered as one of the chief proofs for the evolution of man from a lower animal, and has been considered about 300,000 years old.  Dr. Meyer, of Bonn, proved that it is the skull of a Russian Cossack killed in 1814.  

2.  The Calaveras Skull, in the California State Museum, was placed in a mine-shaft, 150 feet deep, as a practical joke.

3.  The "Colorado Specimen" was pronounced by a Columbia College "scientist" to be "the missing link," one million and a half years old.  Cowboys since proved the bones to be that of a pet monkey which they had buried there.

4.  The Croatian Skeletons (Austria) are the bones of degenerate human beings, -- nothing more.

5.  The Pithecanthropus Erectur has for some years (since 1891) been the most popular relic with evolutionists.  The collection consisted of a skull above the eyes, a leg-bone, and two teeth, -- found in Java at separate places.  The age of this "missing link" was guessed by various scientists to be from one hundred thousand to one million years!  According to measurements the skull is that of an idiot.  (See _The Other Side of Evolution_, Alex. Patterson, D. D. Winona Publ. Co., Chicago, 1903.)

## The Holy Scriptures
\begin{center}
\textbf{A.  The Bible Is God's Revelation to Mankind}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

The Bible, comprising the canonical books of the Old and the New Testament, is God's unerring and only revelation to mankind.

Luke 16, 29:  "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."

1 Thess. 2, 13:  "When ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but, _as it is in truth_, the Word of God."

John 17, 17:  "Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy Word is truth."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony}
\end{center}

"We believe, teach, and confess that the only rule and standard according to which at once all dogmas and teachers should be esteemed and jusged are nothing else than the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament, as it is written:  'Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path' (Ps. 119, 105), and St. Paul:  'Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you, let him be accursed' (Gal. 1, 8). (_Form. Con._, Epit., Introd., ยง 1.)

1.  The evolutionists one and all discredit the narrative in Genesis, first chapter, concerning creation.  Of the Bible, as revelation, Haeckel says:  "It is the invention of man's imagination.  The so-called truth which believers find in it is a human speculation, and the 'childlike' faith in this irrational revelation is only superstition."  (_The Riddle of the Universe_, 123.)

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

Rom. 3, 1. 2:  "What advantage, then hat the Jew?  Much every way:  chiefly, because that unto them were commiteed _the oracles of God_."

Heb. 1, 1. 2:  "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, _hath in these last days spoken unto us_ by His Son."

1 Pet. 1, 16:  "For we have _not followed cunningly devised fables_ when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty."

2.  The so-called higher critics fain would find all kinds of flaws and faults in the Bible:  Creation is a myth; the patriarchs never lived, at least not at the time states; Moses, and most of the other authors, never wrote the books ascribed to them; the contents are unreliable; the so-called prophecies are post-event descriptions, etc., etc.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

1 Tim. 4, 1:  "Now _the Spirit speaketh_ expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to _seducing spirits_ and doctrines of devils."

John 1, 1-3:  "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made."

Luke 20, 37. 38:  "The Lord is the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; for He is not a God of the dead, but of the living."

Luke 24, 27:  "And _beginning at Moses_ and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself."

John 6, 63:  "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."

Matt. 24, 35:  "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away."

John 12, 48:  "He that rejecteth Me, and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."

John 10, 35:  "The Scripture cannot be broken."

\textsc{The Apocryphal Books.} -- Some editions of the Bible contain a number of books called Apocrypha (hidden).  The name implies that the authors are unknown, and their writings of doubtful value.

The Apocrypha of the Old Testament comprise some fourteen books and those of the New Testament about twenty-five.  The latter have never appeared in any Protestant Bible.

In 1546, the Catholic Church decreed, through the Council of Trent, that the old Testament apocryphal books were to be included among the canonical (rule-giving) books of the Bible.  This was done in order to gain certain proof-texts for the doctrines of purgatory, prayers for the dead, and for strengthening the position of the pope generally.  However, no council can decree what shall, or shall not, be the Word of God.  The canonicity of the Bible is deduced from a multitude of proofs peculiarly its own.  The following, among many, may suffice here.  1) The declaration of the different writers that God has spoken through them.  2) The loftiness and sublimity of the Bible-text in comparison with that of secular books.  3) The united testimony of the Church concerning both the Old and the New Testament.  4) The repeated references of Christ and the apostles to numberless statements in the canonical books, but silence as to the apocryphal.  5) The sufficiency of the canonical Scriptures as declared by Christ Himself.  (Luke 16, 31; John 5, 39; 10, 35.)

\begin{center}
\textbf{B.  The Bible is Given by Inspiration of God.}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

The contents of the Bible were revealed to the sacred writers by inspiration of the Holy Spirit

2 Tim. 3, 16:  "All Scripture is given _by inspiration of God_, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."

2 Pet. 1, 21:  "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God _spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost_."

\begin{center}

"And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life; ... who spake by the prophets." -- _Nicene Creed_, ยง 7.

\begin{center}
\textsc{Error.}
\end{center}

The great majority of modern exegetes, especially the so-called higher critics, maintain that "science" forbids the acceptance of an inspiration different from that of a Shakespeare or a Milton.  And even if the different authors were under the influence of a higher power, they were children of their times, and hence their opinions were biased, and they were subject to errors in judgment, etc.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

1 Cor. 2, 12. 13:  "NOw we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might known the things that are freely given to us by God.  Which things also we speak, not in the _words_ which man's wisdom teacheth, but _which the Holy Ghost teacheth_, comparing spiritual things with spiritual."

1 Cor. 2, 7. 10:  "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew.  But _God hath revealed them unto us_ by His Spirit."

Matt. 10, 20:  "For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you."  (2 Sam. 23, 2. 3.)

1 Cor. 1, 23:  "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness."

Gal. 1, 20:  "Now the things which I write unto you, behold before God, I lie not."  (1, 8. 9.)

\textsc{Note.} -- A great many theologians at the present time have given up the belief in verbal inspiration, and contend that God only gave the authors an "impulse" to write, and what to write about, or, at best, that the "concept," or "idea," was inspired.  But this, together with the assertion that the different authors have been mistaken in several things, is simply destroying the foundation of all faith and hope.  If God has not told us in explicit words what His will is, the hope of the Christian is no better than that of a Rationalist.

But a few passages from Scripture will show how the Bible stands on the question.

Ex. 4, 12:  "Now, therefore, go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak."

Ex. 34, 27:  "And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words; for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel."

2 Sam. 23, 2:  "The Spirit of God spake by me, and His Word was upon my tongue."  (Of this Christ says in Mark 12, 36:  "David himself said _by the Holy Ghost_.")

Acts 2, 4:  "And they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance."

Mark 13, 11:  "For it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."

In almost innumerable places we read:  "Thus saith the Lord"; "The Lord said"' "The word of the Lord," and the like, especially numerous in the writings of the prophets.  So also the message of the apostles:--

1 Cor. 2, 13:  "Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth."

1 Thess. 2, 13:  "When ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the Word of God."

\begin{center}
\textbf{C.  The Interpretation of the Bible.}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

The meaning of the words of Scripture must be sought in the Scriptures themselves, not outside of them.

2 Pet. 4, 11:  "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony:--}
\end{center}
"We have, however, another rule, _viz_.:  That the Word of God should frame articles of faith; otherwise no one, not even an angel." -- _Smalcald Articles_, II, 2, 15.

\end{center}

Zwingli and Calvin both declared that human reason must be the judge of Holy Scripture.  Zwingli gives this counsel:  "Philosophical argumentation through conclusions of reasoning must not be neglected." -- _Expos. Chr. Faith_.

Calvin says:  "Can you prove through reasoning that this contains nothing unreasonable?  Yes, if it be conceded that the Lord has instituted nothing that is contrary to reason." -- _Geneva Catechism_.

This is the fundamental error of all sects, ancient and modern.  And the Reformed Churches, one and all, carry the image of their originators.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

Is. 8, 20:  "To the Law and to the testimony:  if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them."

2 Cor. 10, 5:  "We bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."

1 Cor. 2, 14:  "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."

Rom. 9, 20:  "O man, who art thou that repliest against God?"

\textsc{Note.} -- Under the topic "Means of Grace" the doctrine of Holy Scripture will be further discussed.

## Original Sin
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine and Lutheran Testimony}
\end{center}

"All men, after Adam's fall, begotten after the common course of nature, are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without trusting Him, and with fleshly appetites; at that, this disease, or original fault, is truly sin, condemning and bringing eternal death now also upon all that are not born again by the Holy Spirit." -- _Augsb. Conf._, Art. II.)

Gen. 8, 21:  "The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth."  (6, 5.)

Eph. 2, 1:  "Ye were dead in trespasses and sin."

Rom. 3, 22. 23:  "There is no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."

Eph. 2, 3:  "We were by nature the children of wrath."

Ps. 51, 5:  "I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me."

Rom. 5, 12:  "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."

\begin{center}
\textsc{Error.}
\end{center}

The Reformed Churches do not express themselves with sufficient exactness in their definition of Original Sin.  The _Methodists_, for instance, say in their _Articles of Religion_:  "Man is very far gone from original righteousness."  (Art. 7.)  To this a Methodist writer makes the remark that "how far is not stated.  Obviously the meaning is that the image of God is not wholly destroyed."  The practise in the Methodist Church corroborates this assertion.  The doctrine of Original Sin is now very rarely taught from Reformed pulpits, and has all but disappeared from the sectarian press.

Rom. 7, 18:  "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing."

Rom. 8, 7:  "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither, indeed, can be."  (1 Cor. 2, 14; John 3, 6.)

Ps. 53, 3:  "The wicked are estranged from before birth; they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies."  (Is. 48, 8.)
