## Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

Of the many religions in the world, ancient as well as modern, the religion of the Bible is the only true one.

Acts 17, 29. 30:  "Forasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.  And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent."

John 17, 3:  "And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent."  (John 3, 18; 1 Cor. 8, 4; Ex. 20, 3-6.)

"Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the true Christian faith.  Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly." -- _Athanasian Creed_.

1.  Carnal mind is in enmity against God.  (Rom. 8, 7.)  Hence man's unwillingness to be governed by Him.  He tries to forgetHim, deny Him; but all to no purpose,-- except, perhaps, for a time.  But the devil is always trying some method whereby he may rob man of the Word of God, so that he shall not believe and be saved.  (Luke 8, 12.)  And one way of accomplishing this is to make him believe that one religion is as good as another, or that Christians "will not be alone about inheriting heaven."

The Swiss reformer Zwingli believed "that all the ancient noble heathens who walked uprightly according to the light they had were also saved."  (_Expos_. _Fidei_, II, 559.)

The Quaker Barclay, in his _Apology_ (10, 2), voices the same thought as regards heathen, Turks, and Jews at the present time.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}

Acts 4, 12:  "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved."  (See Gospel of St. John.)

1 Cor. 1, 21:  "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."  (2 Thess. 1, 7-10:  "punishment for all who do not know and obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.")

2 Thess. 2, 10-12:  "Because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, ... God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth."

John 14, 6:  "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me."

Christ warned against being an "unbeliever, a heathen and a publican."  (Matt. 18, 17; Mark 16, 17.)

2.  A large class of unbelievers call themselves agnostics.  This sounds better than atheists and freethinkers, but they are in reality their triplet brother.  The "believ" of the agnostic is "We do not know whether there is a God."  ("The problem of existence has not been solved, and it is insoluble":  (Thomas Huxley.)  This dictum has been applied, not only to human existence, but to God Himself, as well as to His revelation.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

John 1, 14:  "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."

1 John 1, 1. 3:  "That which was from the beginning, which we have seen which we have heard, ... declare we unto you."

2 Pet. 1, 16:  "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eye-witnesses of His majesty."  (See vv. 17. 18.)

Rom. 1, 19:  "even the heathen acknowledge the existence of God.

_What Is an Atheist?_ -- A snare to the simple-minded Christian is the oft repeated assertion that so and so was no atheist, because he had confessed his belief in a personal God or, perhaps, in "a Higher Power."  It is true, the words of the Psalmist (14, 1), "The fool saith in his heart, There is no God," describe more nearly the person called "atheist."  But all who do not confess the true God are properly to be classed as having no God at all.  Christ says:  "He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father."  (John 5, 23.)  "Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven."  (Matt. 10, 33.)  And the Holy Spirit testifies:  "Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father."  (1 John 2, 23.  Compare also 2 John, v. 9.)

_Lodge Religion_. -- Under this head must be ranged all lodges which require a "belief in a Supreme Being" from their members, but who do not define this "Being" as the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and studiously avoid using the name of Jesus in their so-called prayers.  Silently (and here intentionally) to omit a confession of the Savior is to deny Him, and be classed as heathen.  (Matt. 18, 17.)  And Christ explicitly teaches that He is the Way, the Life, and the Truth, and that no man cometh unto the Father but by Him.  (John 14, 6.)

_Evolution_. -- The notion is also prevalent that Christianity, revealed religion, "is subject to the laws of evolution."  Aside from the fact that "the laws of evolution" are only imaginings of depraved human nature, which fain would escape just punishment at the hands of God, "progressive Christianity" is simply an absurdity.  What of a Christianity in which the life, teachings, and deeds of a Christ Jesus, little by little, should be superseded by -- what?  Can you think of a moral law which could supersede the Ten Commandments?  Of a just God more righteous than Jehovah?  more loving than Jesus?  more merciful than He who sent His only-begotten Son as the Savior for the whole world?  more merciful than He who embraces the Prodigal (Luke 15, 20), pardons the adulteress (John 8, 11), promises heaven to the thief on the cross (Luke 29, 43), and prayed even for His enemies?

No doubt, it is considered the height of wisdom at the present time to assert that "the law of evolution" also underlies the Christian religion. But what does history tell us concerning those who have come under its spell?  Heathenism is nothing but the result of a trial to improve on the revelation and government of God.  The Babylonian captivity of the Jews and the final dispersement of them over all the earth is the outcome of a similar experiment.  The early Christian Churches in Asia and elsewhere tried their hands at the same thing, and were rewarded by -- Mohammedanism.  And what is popery, Jesuitism, rationalism but the outcome of efforts to apply "the law of evolution" to religion!  Evolution, indeed, but _always_ an evolution downward.

Though the theory on which Darwinian evolution rests has been discarded as insufficient by conscientious scientists, yet the reechoing of it is still heard in some of our higher institutions of learning, not to mention our normal schools, where our common-school teachers are trained.  Hence we often read of this or that "professor," in our daily papers, who adjudges the remains of some prehistoric (?) animal as being so or so many millions of years old.  These opinions finally find their way into text-books and are henceforth promulgated as "gospel truths."  But what reliance may be put upon them the following well-supported facts will show.

1.  The Neanderthal Skull, has, since 1856, been offered as one of the chief proofs for the evolution of man from a lower animal, and has been considered about 300,000 years old.  Dr. Meyer, of Bonn, proved that it is the skull of a Russian Cossack killed in 1814.  

2.  The Calaveras Skull, in the California State Museum, was placed in a mine-shaft, 150 feet deep, as a practical joke.

3.  The "Colorado Specimen" was pronounced by a Columbia College "scientist" to be "the missing link," one million and a half years old.  Cowboys since proved the bones to be that of a pet monkey which they had buried there.

4.  The Croatian Skeletons (Austria) are the bones of degenerate human beings, -- nothing more.

5.  The Pithecanthropus Erectur has for some years (since 1891) been the most popular relic with evolutionists.  The collection consisted of a skull above the eyes, a leg-bone, and two teeth, -- found in Java at separate places.  The age of this "missing link" was guessed by various scientists to be from one hundred thousand to one million years!  According to measurements the skull is that of an idiot.  (See _The Other Side of Evolution_, Alex. Patterson, D. D. Winona Publ. Co., Chicago, 1903.)

## The Holy Scriptures
\begin{center}
\textbf{A.  The Bible Is God's Revelation to Mankind}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

The Bible, comprising the canonical books of the Old and the New Testament, is God's unerring and only revelation to mankind.

Luke 16, 29:  "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."

1 Thess. 2, 13:  "When ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but, _as it is in truth_, the Word of God."

John 17, 17:  "Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy Word is truth."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony}
\end{center}

"We believe, teach, and confess that the only rule and standard according to which at once all dogmas and teachers should be esteemed and jusged are nothing else than the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament, as it is written:  'Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path' (Ps. 119, 105), and St. Paul:  'Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you, let him be accursed' (Gal. 1, 8). (_Form. Con._, Epit., Introd., § 1.)

1.  The evolutionists one and all discredit the narrative in Genesis, first chapter, concerning creation.  Of the Bible, as revelation, Haeckel says:  "It is the invention of man's imagination.  The so-called truth which believers find in it is a human speculation, and the 'childlike' faith in this irrational revelation is only superstition."  (_The Riddle of the Universe_, 123.)

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

Rom. 3, 1. 2:  "What advantage, then hat the Jew?  Much every way:  chiefly, because that unto them were commiteed _the oracles of God_."

Heb. 1, 1. 2:  "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, _hath in these last days spoken unto us_ by His Son."

1 Pet. 1, 16:  "For we have _not followed cunningly devised fables_ when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty."

2.  The so-called higher critics fain would find all kinds of flaws and faults in the Bible:  Creation is a myth; the patriarchs never lived, at least not at the time states; Moses, and most of the other authors, never wrote the books ascribed to them; the contents are unreliable; the so-called prophecies are post-event descriptions, etc., etc.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

1 Tim. 4, 1:  "Now _the Spirit speaketh_ expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to _seducing spirits_ and doctrines of devils."

John 1, 1-3:  "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made."

Luke 20, 37. 38:  "The Lord is the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; for He is not a God of the dead, but of the living."

Luke 24, 27:  "And _beginning at Moses_ and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself."

John 6, 63:  "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."

Matt. 24, 35:  "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away."

John 12, 48:  "He that rejecteth Me, and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."

John 10, 35:  "The Scripture cannot be broken."

\textsc{The Apocryphal Books.} -- Some editions of the Bible contain a number of books called Apocrypha (hidden).  The name implies that the authors are unknown, and their writings of doubtful value.

The Apocrypha of the Old Testament comprise some fourteen books and those of the New Testament about twenty-five.  The latter have never appeared in any Protestant Bible.

In 1546, the Catholic Church decreed, through the Council of Trent, that the old Testament apocryphal books were to be included among the canonical (rule-giving) books of the Bible.  This was done in order to gain certain proof-texts for the doctrines of purgatory, prayers for the dead, and for strengthening the position of the pope generally.  However, no council can decree what shall, or shall not, be the Word of God.  The canonicity of the Bible is deduced from a multitude of proofs peculiarly its own.  The following, among many, may suffice here.  1) The declaration of the different writers that God has spoken through them.  2) The loftiness and sublimity of the Bible-text in comparison with that of secular books.  3) The united testimony of the Church concerning both the Old and the New Testament.  4) The repeated references of Christ and the apostles to numberless statements in the canonical books, but silence as to the apocryphal.  5) The sufficiency of the canonical Scriptures as declared by Christ Himself.  (Luke 16, 31; John 5, 39; 10, 35.)

\begin{center}
\textbf{B.  The Bible is Given by Inspiration of God.}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

The contents of the Bible were revealed to the sacred writers by inspiration of the Holy Spirit

2 Tim. 3, 16:  "All Scripture is given _by inspiration of God_, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."

2 Pet. 1, 21:  "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God _spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost_."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Testimony of the Creed:--}
\end{center}

"And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life; ... who spake by the prophets." -- _Nicene Creed_, § 7.

\begin{center}
\textsc{Error.}
\end{center}

The great majority of modern exegetes, especially the so-called higher critics, maintain that "science" forbids the acceptance of an inspiration different from that of a Shakespeare or a Milton.  And even if the different authors were under the influence of a higher power, they were children of their times, and hence their opinions were biased, and they were subject to errors in judgment, etc.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

1 Cor. 2, 12. 13:  "NOw we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might known the things that are freely given to us by God.  Which things also we speak, not in the _words_ which man's wisdom teacheth, but _which the Holy Ghost teacheth_, comparing spiritual things with spiritual."

1 Cor. 2, 7. 10:  "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew.  But _God hath revealed them unto us_ by His Spirit."

Matt. 10, 20:  "For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you."  (2 Sam. 23, 2. 3.)

1 Cor. 1, 23:  "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness."

Gal. 1, 20:  "Now the things which I write unto you, behold before God, I lie not."  (1, 8. 9.)

\textsc{Note.} -- A great many theologians at the present time have given up the belief in verbal inspiration, and contend that God only gave the authors an "impulse" to write, and what to write about, or, at best, that the "concept," or "idea," was inspired.  But this, together with the assertion that the different authors have been mistaken in several things, is simply destroying the foundation of all faith and hope.  If God has not told us in explicit words what His will is, the hope of the Christian is no better than that of a Rationalist.

But a few passages from Scripture will show how the Bible stands on the question.

Ex. 4, 12:  "Now, therefore, go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak."

Ex. 34, 27:  "And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words; for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel."

2 Sam. 23, 2:  "The Spirit of God spake by me, and His Word was upon my tongue."  (Of this Christ says in Mark 12, 36:  "David himself said _by the Holy Ghost_.")

Acts 2, 4:  "And they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance."

Mark 13, 11:  "For it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."

In almost innumerable places we read:  "Thus saith the Lord"; "The Lord said"' "The word of the Lord," and the like, especially numerous in the writings of the prophets.  So also the message of the apostles:--

1 Cor. 2, 13:  "Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth."

1 Thess. 2, 13:  "When ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the Word of God."

\begin{center}
\textbf{C.  The Interpretation of the Bible.}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

The meaning of the words of Scripture must be sought in the Scriptures themselves, not outside of them.

2 Pet. 4, 11:  "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony:--}
\end{center}
"We have, however, another rule, _viz_.:  That the Word of God should frame articles of faith; otherwise no one, not even an angel." -- _Smalcald Articles_, II, 2, 15.

Zwingli and Calvin both declared that human reason must be the judge of Holy Scripture.  Zwingli gives this counsel:  "Philosophical argumentation through conclusions of reasoning must not be neglected." -- _Expos. Chr. Faith_.

Calvin says:  "Can you prove through reasoning that this contains nothing unreasonable?  Yes, if it be conceded that the Lord has instituted nothing that is contrary to reason." -- _Geneva Catechism_.

This is the fundamental error of all sects, ancient and modern.  And the Reformed Churches, one and all, carry the image of their originators.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}
\end{center}

Is. 8, 20:  "To the Law and to the testimony:  if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them."

2 Cor. 10, 5:  "We bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."

1 Cor. 2, 14:  "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."

Rom. 9, 20:  "O man, who art thou that repliest against God?"

\textsc{Note.} -- Under the topic "Means of Grace" the doctrine of Holy Scripture will be further discussed.

## Original Sin
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine and Lutheran Testimony}
\end{center}

"All men, after Adam's fall, begotten after the common course of nature, are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without trusting Him, and with fleshly appetites; at that, this disease, or original fault, is truly sin, condemning and bringing eternal death now also upon all that are not born again by the Holy Spirit." -- _Augsb. Conf._, Art. II.)

Gen. 8, 21:  "The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth."  (6, 5.)

Eph. 2, 1:  "Ye were dead in trespasses and sin."

Rom. 3, 22. 23:  "There is no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."

Eph. 2, 3:  "We were by nature the children of wrath."

Ps. 51, 5:  "I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me."

Rom. 5, 12:  "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."

\begin{center}
\textsc{Error.}
\end{center}

The Reformed Churches do not express themselves with sufficient exactness in their definition of Original Sin.  The _Methodists_, for instance, say in their _Articles of Religion_:  "Man is very far gone from original righteousness."  (Art. 7.)  To this a Methodist writer makes the remark that "how far is not stated.  Obviously the meaning is that the image of God is not wholly destroyed."  The practise in the Methodist Church corroborates this assertion.  The doctrine of Original Sin is now very rarely taught from Reformed pulpits, and has all but disappeared from the sectarian press.

\begin{center}
\textsl{But God says:--}

Rom. 7, 18:  "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing."

Rom. 8, 7:  "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither, indeed, can be."  (1 Cor. 2, 14; John 3, 6.)

Ps. 53, 3:  "The wicked are estranged from before birth; they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies."  (Is. 48, 8.)

## Redemption
\begin{center}
\textbf{A.  Redemption Is Through Christ.}

\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

Gal. 3, 13:  "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us."  

Matt. 5, 17:  "Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill."  (3, 15.)

Rom. 8, 3. 4:  "For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony:--}
\end{center}

"For since Christ is not alone man, but God and man in one undivided Person, He was as little subject to the Law, because He is the Lord of the Law, as, in His own Person, to suffering and death.  Therefore His obedience, not only in suffering and dying, but also that He in our stead was voluntarily subject to the Law, and fulfilled it by His obedience, is imputed to us for righteousness, so that, on account of this complete obedience, which by deed and by suffering, and in life and in death, He rendered His heavenly Father for us, God forgives our sins, regards us godly and righteous, and eternally saves us." -- _Form. Conc._, III, § 15.

\begin{center}
\textsc{Error.}
\end{center}

The _Moravians_ (Brethren) and _Methodists_ speak in their catechisms, under this head, of Christ, only as a _type_, or _example_.  "How is the life of Christ on earth to be considered?  His life on earth was perfectly holy, and is therefore an example for us to follow."  (_Mor. Cat._, Qu. 48.) -- "What does the life of Christ represent?  A prototype of perfect goodness and holiness." -- _Meth. Cat._, No. 3, p. 23.

\textsc{Note.--} Present-day Christianity, among the sects and enthusiasts, is all of this variety.  "Be good," "Follow in His steps," are slogans heard on every hand.  Forsooth, true Christians also strive to be good, and to follow in the footprints of the Savior.  But these things do not _make_, but only _adorn_ a Christian.  We are saved, not by following "in His steps," but by accepting His redemption.

Gal. 4, 4. 5:  "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, amde of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."

_Presbyterians, Congregationalists_, and _Calvinistic Baptists_ state in their confessions that Christ has redeemed the elect _only_.  In the _Westminster Confession_ we read:  "As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, He, by the eternal and most free purpose of His will, foreordained all the means thereunto.... _Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called_, justified adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only." -- (III, § 6.)  And again:  "The Lord Jesus, by His perfect obedience and sacrifice of Himself, ... hath fully satisfied the justice of His Father, and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, _for all those whom the Father hath given unto Him_" (_i. e._, for the elect _only_).--_Westm.

1 Tim. 4, 10:  "We trust in the living God, who is the Savior of _all men_, specially of those that believe."

1 John 2, 1. 2:  "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the _whole world_."  (rom. 5, 10; Is. 53.)

2 Pet. 2, 1:  "Denying the Lord that brought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."  (Christ died also for those who by reason of their unbelief are finally lost.)

## Conversion
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

"Conversion is not an effect of man's own power and strength, but an act and gift of the Holy Spirit." -- _Chemnitz's Enchiridion_.

Acts 11, 18:  "God hath also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."

Phil. 2, 13:  "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure."

Heb. 13, 20. 21:  "Now the God of peace ... make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight."

John 15, 5:  "Without Me ye can do nothing."

2 Cor. 3, 5:  "Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony:--}
\end{center}

"In spiritual and divine things the intellect, heart, and will of the unregenerate man cannot, in any way, by their own natural power, understand, believe, accept, think, will, begin, effect, do, work, or concur in working anything, but they are entirely dead to good and corrupt; so that in man's nature, since the fall, there is, before regeneration, not the least spark of spiritual power remaining still present, by which, of himself, he can prepare himself for God's grace, or accept the offered grace, or, for and of himself, be capable of it, or apply or accommodate himself thereto, or, by his own powers, be able of himself, as of himself, to aid, do, work, or concur in working anything for his conversion, either entirely, or in half, or in even the least or most inconsiderable part, but he is the servant and slave of sin (John 8, 34; Eph. 2, 2; 2 Tim. 2, 26).

The so-called _Free-will Baptists_ tell by their very name what they teach about conversion.  But not so the _Methodists_.  In section 8 of their _Articles of Religion_ they seem to disclaim the concurrence of the Holy Spirit, but their chief teachers are self-confessed _Synergists_, and their whole evangelistic and revivalistic work is based on the old heretical belief in freedom of the will.  John Wesley says in his _Scripture Doctrine of Predestination_:  "Oh, you are a defender of the freedom of the will, you assume a free will in man!  I assume nothing but what Scripture says, and that you ought to allow me to assume.  I do not assume that a man has will or power to do anything good of himself, but by the grace of God we may do everything.  We believe that the moment Adam fell, he had no more freedom of the will, but that when God, in His free grace, promised him and his seed a Savior, He then _returned_ to humanity a free will and power to accept the proffered salvation."  Professor W. F. Warner, in his _Systematic Theology_, speaks in similar terms.  Also T. N. Ralston, in his _Outlines of Theology_.  _The Cumberland Presbyterians_ also err here.  In their _Origin and Doctrine_ we read:  "We object to the idea that man is passive in matters pertaining to salvation until God revives and renews him."  (p. 86.)

To this the _Augsburg Confession_ makes this reply:  "Concerning free will they teach that man's will has some liberty to work a civil righteousness, and to choose between things that are subject to human reason, but that it has no power to work the righteousness of God, or a spiritual righteousness, without the Spirit of God, because that the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 2, 14.  But this is wrought in the heart when man receives the Spirit of God through the Word." -- Art XVIII.

## Predestination

a.  God has shown mercy to all mankind, and wishes all to be saved.

1 Tim. 2, 4:  "God will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."

2 Pet. 3, 9:  "The Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."

Ezek. 33, 11:  "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live."  (18, 33; John 3, 16.)

"Therefore, if we wish with profit to consider our eternal election to salvation, we must ine very way hold rigidly and firmly to this, _viz_., that, as the preaching of repentance, so also the promise of the Gospel is universal, _i. e._, it pertains to all men (Luke 24, 47).  Therefore Christ has commanded 'that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations.'  For God so loved the world, and gave His Son (John 3, 16).  Christ bore the sins of the world (John 1, 29), gave His flesh for the life of the world (John 6, 51); His blood is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world (1 John 1, 7; 2, 2)," etc. -- _Form.

To be a _Calvinsit_ is to believe what has been properly called the "monstrous doctrine" that God does _not_ desire the salvation of _all_ mankind.  IN his _Institutes_ Calvin declares that "by predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which He determined with Himself whatever He wished to happen with regard to every man.  All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, _others to eternal damnation_; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life _or death_."  (III, 21, 5.)  "He arranges all things by His sovereign counsel, in such a way that individuals are born who are doomed from their inception to certain death, and are to glorify Him by their destruction."  (III, 23, 6.)

b.  In choosing His elect, God did not proceed in an arbitrary absolute manner, but chose them in Christ Jesus.

Eph. 1, 3-6:  "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spriitual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us _in Him_ before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love; having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath _made us accepted in the Beloved_."

"Therefore this eternal election of God is to be considered in Christ, and not beyond or without Christ.  For 'in Christ,' testifies the Apostle Paul (Eph. 1, 4 sq.), 'He hath chosen us before the foundation of the world,' as it is written:  'He hath made us accepted in the Beloved.'" -- _Form.

1. The fountainhead of modern error concerning this doctrine is _John Calvin_.  To him predestination was the central doctrine of the Christian religion.  And more, -- predestination he considers strictly an arbitrary act of God.  "I repeat," he says, "that we must ever return to the mere pleasure of the divine will." -- _Iinst._, III, 23, 4.

2. The _Reformed Church_, specially so called, expresses its belief thus:  "If we are not to be ashamed of the Gospel, we must confess what it clearly teaches, that God, according to His eternal pleasure and moved by no other cause, has ordained some unto salvation, whereas others were rejected." -- _Cons. Genev._, 224.

3. _Congregationalists_ and _Baptists_, in their respective confessions, agree with the _Presbyterians_ when the latter say:  "By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestined unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death." -- _Westm. Conf._, III, 3, 7.

\textsc{Note.} -- In 1887 and 1903, the Presbyterian Church (North) added two chapters to their confession (34, 35) and also appended a _Declaratory Statement_ concerning predestination.  According to this "Statement," Chapter III is to be understood as _not_ teaching foreordination to death; and Chapter X, 3, that no children dying in infancy are lost.  But as long as the confession is still in force, -- and all did not vote for the "Statement," -- the situation is practically unchanged.

Titus 2, 11:  "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to _all men_."  (2 Pet. 2, 1.)

\textsc{Note.} -- The error of Calvinism does not only consist in denying an election _in Christ_, but especially in teaching an _election to perdition_.  The Lutheran Church teaches, according to Scripture, that there is an election unto salvation, but _not_ unto condemnation.  The _Formula of Concord_ (XI, 5) says:  "But the eternal election of God, or predestination, _i. e._, God's appointment to salvation, pertains not at the same time to the godly and the wicked, _but only to the children of God_."

On an other phase of this mysterious question we will let _Dr. Martin Chemintz_ speak.  He was not only the author of the Eleventh Article in the _Formula of Concord_, but, at the time of its composition, superintendant of the churches of Braunschweig.  In his _Enchiridion_, a work written especially for the instructino of the clergy in his diocese, he puts the following question:  "Does God make such election first after a time, as when men have become penitent and believers, or is it made on account of their piety which God foresees?"  _Answer_:  "St. Paul says in Eph. 1, 4:  'He hath chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world'; and in 2 Tim. 1, 9:  'He hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.'  Hence, the electino of God does not follow after our faith and righteousness, but goes before them, as a cause of it all.  Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified, Rom. 8, 30.  And in Eph. 1, 4, Paul does not say that we were elected because we _were_ holy or had _become_ holy, but He says:  He hath chosen us that we should _be_ holy.  For predestination is a cause of everything pertaining to salvation, as Paul says:  'We have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who workth all things after the counsel fo His own will, that we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ.' (Eph. 1, 11. 12.)  And this election is not made in view of our present or future deeds, but according to His own purpose and grace. (Rom. 9; 2 Tim. 1.)"

## Justification
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

Rom. 8, 33:  "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?  It is God that justifieth."

Gal. 3, 6:  "Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."

Eph. 2, 8. 9:  "For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast."

Rom. 3, 24:  "Being justified freely by His grace through the recemption that is in Christ Jesus."  3, 28:  "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law."

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony:--}
\end{center}

"Men cannot be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for Christ's sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into favor, and that their sins are forgiven for Christ's sake, who, by His death, hath made satisfaction for our sins.  This faith God imputes for righteousness in His sight.  (Rom. 3 and 4.)" -- _Augsb. Conf._, Art. IV.

"This article concerning justification by faith is the chief in the entire Christian doctrine, without which no poor conscience has any firm consolation, or can know aright the riches of the grace of Christ, as Dr. Luther also has written:  'If only this article remain in view pure, the Christian Church also remains pure, and is harmonious and without all sects; but if it do not remain pure, it is not possible to resist any error or fanatical spirit.'  And concerning this article Paul especially says that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.  Therefore in this article he emphasizes with so much zeal and earnestness the exclusive particles, or the word whereby the works of men are excluded (namely, 'without Law,' 'without works,' 'out of grace' 'freely,' Rom. 3, 28; 4, 5; Eph. 2, 8. 9), in order to indicate how highly necessary it is that in this article, by the side of the presentation of the pure doctrine, the antithesis, _i. e._, all contrary dogmas, by this means be separated, exposed, and rejected...

"Concerning the righteousness of faith before God we unanimously believe, teach, and confess, according to the comprehensive summary of our faith and convession above presented, _viz._, that a poor sinful man is justified before God, _i. e._, absolved and declared free and exempt from all his sins and from the sentence of a well-delivered condemnation, and adopted into sonship and heirship of eternal life, without any merit or worth of his own, also without all preceding, present, or subsequent works, out of pure grace, alone because of the sole merit, complete obedience, bitter suffering, death, and resurrection of our Lord Christ, whose obedience is reckoned to us for righteousness." -- _Form. Conc._, III, 6. 7. 9.

1.  The _Catholic Church_, the mother of heresies regarding justification, teaches according to its apologist, J. Adam Moehler:  "The Council of Trent represents justification as a renewal of the inward man, by means whereof we become really just, as inherent in the believer, and as a restoration of the primeval state of humanity.  On this account, the same council observes that by the act of justification, faith, hope, and charity are infused into the heart of man; and that it is only in this way he is truly united with Christ and becometh a living member of His body.  In other words, justification is considered to be sanctification and forgiveness of sins, as the latter is involved in the former, and the former in the latter; it is considered an infusion of the love of God into our hearts through the Holy Spirit; and the interior state of the justified man is regarded as holy feeling, as a sanctified inclination of the will, as habitual pleasure and joy in the divine Law, as a decided and active disposition to fulfil the same in all the occurrences of life, -- in short, as a way of feeling which is in itself acceptable and well pleasing to God." -- _Symbolism_, p. 104.

\textsc{Note.} -- It was on account of this grand confusion of "infusion," "sanctification," "feeling," and "inclination" that Luther could find no "joy in the divine Law" nor peace in the Catholic Church.  This came to him only after learning the meaning of Paul's words:  "Justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."  (Rom. 5, 1.)

2.  To receive salvation through grace alone is repugnant to self-seeking, guilt-feeling human nature.  Hence not only the pope, but many others have invented schemes of salvation which also include more or less of human efforts.  As representatives of these may be mentioned the _Arminians_.  Their celebrated teacher Limborch writes:  "Be it known that we, when we state that we are justified through faith, do not exclude works, but rather include them." -- _Chr. Theol._, VI, 4, 22.

The _Quakers_, representing more nearly our every-day, mushroom religious reformers, teach "that we cannot, as some Protestants unwisely have done, exclude good works from justification.  They are absolutely necessary, forsooth, not as a case on account of which we are justified, but as something _in_ which we are justified, and without which we cannot be justified." -- _Barclay_, _Apol._, 7, 3. 4.

\textsc{Note.} -- Theoretically, the Reformed sects confess justification by faith alone, but to a large extent their every-day religion is Arminianism pure and simple.

Gal. 2, 16:  "Knowing that a man is not justified by works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ."

Rom. 4, 4. 5:  "Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."

Rom. 11, 6:  "And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.  But if it be of works, then it is no more grace; otherwise work is no more work."

Rom. 5, 1:  "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

Rom. 1, 17:  "The just shall live by faith."

Gal. 3, 26:  "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."

\textsc{Note.} -- Though Christ expressly promises all those "who hunger and thirst after righteousness that they shall be filled" (Matt. 5, 6), yet the _Catholic Church_ would have its members dougt that any one can come to any certainty in the matter.  No wonder "good" Catholics are willing to pay for indulgences and the reading of masses.

However, the _Methodists_ have a touch of the same sickness.  Their revival preachers, especially, do not direct the occupants of "the anxious seat," or "mourners' bench," to the precious promises of the Lord in His Word, but to their own feeling.  And this feeling is created by "hard praying," shouting, and singing, until the "subject" hysterically shouts for joy.  He is then declared "saved."

1 John 3, 20:  "For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."

John 4, 46-53:  The nobleman at Capernaum simply clung to the words of Christ:  "Go thy way; thy son liveth."  "And himself believed, and his whole house."

\textsc{Note.} -- _Calvinists_ of whatever name (Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist) do not only teach that Christ died only for the elect, but also that these alone receive the justifying faith, which they can never wholly lose.

This is emphatically disproved by the example of David and Peter.  Both certainly fell from grace, and fell deeply, but were again restored.

Paul bemoans the fall of Demas, counsels earnestly the exclusion of the fornicator at Corinth, but recommends him to adoption again after he had become penitent.

## Sanctification
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

a.  Perfect holiness cannot be obtained during our natural life.

Phil. 3, 12:  "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect:  but I follow after, if I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."  (Comp. v. 13.)

1 Thess. 4, 1:  "As ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, _so ye would abound more and more_."

Gal. 5, 17:  "For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."  (Heb. 12, 1.)

\begin{center}
\textsl{Lutheran Testimony:--}
\end{center}

"But since in this life believers have not been renewed perfectly or completely (for although their sins are covered by the perfect obedience of Christ, so that they are not imputed to believers for condemnation, and also, through the Holy Ghost, the mortificatino of the old Adam and the renewal in the spirit of their mind in begun), nevertheless the old Adam always clings to them in their nature and all its internal and external powers.  Of this the apostle has written:  'I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.' (Rom. 7, 18.)  And again:  'For that which I do I allow not; for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.'  Again:  'I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin.'  Also:  'The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.'

"Therefore, because of these lusts of the flesh, the truly believing, elect, and regenerate children of God require not only the daily instruction and admonition, warning, and threatening, of the Law, but also frequently reproofs, whereby they are roused and follow the Spirit of God.  (Ps. 19, 71; 1 Cor. 9, 27; Heb. 12, 8.)" -- _Form. Conc._, VI, 7-9.

_Catholics_ and _Methodists_ both teach complete perfection.  The former even claim that, by living up to their monastic vows, monks or nuns may attain such perfection that they are able to _sell_ to others from their superabundant stock of holiness.  This "stock" is handled by "the Church," and sold to the needy, according to the Bull _Unigenitus_ of Pope Clement VI.

But the _Methodists_ do not lag far behind.  Wesley has written a special treatise on "Christian Perfection," a standard work among Methodists to this day, in which he maintains that "a Methodist is one who loves the Lord God with _all_ his heart, with _all_ his soul, with _all_ his mind, with _all_ his strength."  (§ 10.)  "But whom do you mean by 'one that is perfect'?  We mean one in whom is 'the mind which was in Christ,' one 'who so walketh as Christ also walked'; a man 'that hath clean hands and a pure heart,' or that is 'cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit'; one in whom is 'no occasion of stumbling,' and who, accordingly, 'does not commit sin.'"  (§ 15, 4.)  In his _Smaller Catechism_ Dr. W. Nast says:  "Can and must a child of God, in this life, be cleansed from all sin?  Yes.  God's command is:  'Ye shall be holy, for I am holy'; and His promise is that, if we confess our sins, He will cleanse us from all unrighteousness, 1 John 1, 9."

Rom. 14, 23:  "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin."

Heb. 11, 6:  "But without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must bleieve that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

Matt. 12, 33:  "For the tree is known by its fruit."

Also that truly good works are done, not from our own natural powers, but when by faith the person is reconciled with God, and renewed by the Holy Spirit, or (as Paul says) 'created anew in Christ Jesus to good works,' Eph. 2, 10." -- _Form. Conc._, IV, 7.

That the semipelagian _Catholic Church_, whose chief hope of salvation rests on human efforts, is the chief offender in this point, goes without saying.  At the Council of Trent the following canon was accepted:  "Whoever says that all deeds done before justification - be they of one kind of another - are truly sins, or merit the wrath of God; or who teaches that the more earnestly one strives to make himself qualified for grace, the more he sins; may he be cursed."  (Sess. 6, 7.) - To this _Chemnitz_ in his _Examen_, replies:  "If the deeds in themselves are not sinful, how do they become so?  I answer:  The heart as GOd's creation is good, but is, on account of sin, nevertheless called evil.  In like manner, deeds which not in themselves are evil become befouled and defiled with the unbeliever, because theya re done by people who are not reconciled with God, nor born again, but are full of guilt and sin.  For God does not judge according to outward appearance, but according to the state of the heart."  "The so-called virtues of unbelievers are not good deeds, but sins, for two reasons:  First, as to their _intention_.  It is a notable saying of St. Augustine that not the deed, but the purpose of the deed, decides virtue and vice.  For, he says, true virtues are services rendered God in the children of man and the gifts of God in the children of men.  Secondly, there is no good fruit which has not grown on the root of love.  But love, according to Gal. 5, 22, is the fruit of the Spirit.  But this is lacking in them that are not born again.  Therefore their good deeds cannot be rated as virtues.  A foul tree can bear only foul fruit, that is, sins only.  Or according to St. Augustine:  'Whatsoever is not of faith is sin, Rom. 14, 23.  This is not to be understood of meats alone (he says) but it is a general truth.'" - Bendixen Ed., 92. 93.

This elucidation is at the present time of special value, since we are so often told of "moral life," "moral uplift," "moral force," etc., where the condition is only common decency - or hidden indecency.

Luke 4, 18. 19. 21 (Jesus reads Is. 61, 1-3):  "'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath annointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.'

"The adversaries feign that Paul abolishes the Law of Moses, and that Christ succeeds as a new lawgiver in such a way that He does not freely grant the remission of sins, but on account of the works of other laws, if any are now desired...
