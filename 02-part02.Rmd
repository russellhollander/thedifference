## Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion
\begin{center}
\textsc{Bible Doctrine.}
\end{center}

Of the many religions in the world, ancient as well as modern, the religion of the Bible is the only true one.

Acts 17, 29. 30:  "Forasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.  And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent."

John 17, 3:  "And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent."  (John 3, 18; 1 Cor. 8, 4; Ex. 20, 3-6.)

"Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the true Christian faith.  Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly." -- _Athanasian Creed_.

1.  Carnal mind is in enmity against God.  (Rom. 8, 7.)  Hence man's unwillingness to be governed by Him.  He tries to forgetHim, deny Him; but all to no purpose,-- except, perhaps, for a time.  But the devil is always trying some method whereby he may rob man of the Word of God, so that he shall not believe and be saved.  (Luke 8, 12.)  And one way of accomplishing this is to make him believe that one religion is as good as another, or that Christians "will not be alone about inheriting heaven."

The Swiss reformer Zwingli believed "that all the ancient noble heathens who walked uprightly according to the light they had were also saved."  (_Expos_. _Fidei_, II, 559.)

The Quaker Barclay, in his _Apology_ (10, 2), voices the same thought as regards heathen, Turks, and Jews at the present time.

Acts 4, 12:  "Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved."  (See Gospel of St. John.)

1 Cor. 1, 21:  "For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."  (2 Thess. 1, 7-10:  "punishment for all who do not know and obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.")

2 Thess. 2, 10-12:  "Because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, ... God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth."

John 14, 6:  "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me."

Christ warned against being an "unbeliever, a heathen and a publican."  (Matt. 18, 17; Mark 16, 17.)

2.  A large class of unbelievers call themselves agnostics.  This sounds better than atheists and freethinkers, but they are in reality their triplet brother.  The "believ" of the agnostic is "We do not know whether there is a God."  ("The problem of existence has not been solved, and it is insoluble":  (Thomas Huxley.)  This dictum has been applied, not only to human existence, but to God Himself, as well as to His revelation.

John 1, 14:  "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."

1 John 1, 1. 3:  "That which was from the beginning, which we have seen which we have heard, ... declare we unto you."

2 Pet. 1, 16:  "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eye-witnesses of His majesty."  (See vv. 17. 18.)

Rom. 1, 19:  "even the heathen acknowledge the existence of God.

_What Is an Atheist?_ -- A snare to the simple-minded Christian is the oft repeated assertion that so and so was no atheist, because he had confessed his belief in a personal God or, perhaps, in "a Higher Power."  It is true, the words of the Psalmist (14, 1), "The fool saith in his heart, There is no God," describe more nearly the person called "atheist."  But all who do not confess the true God are properly to be classed as having no God at all.  Christ says:  "He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father."  (John 5, 23.)  "Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven."  (Matt. 10, 33.)  And the Holy Spirit testifies:  "Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father."  (1 John 2, 23.  Compare also 2 John, v. 9.)

_Lodge Religion_. -- Under this head must be ranged all lodges which require a "belief in a Supreme Being" from their members, but who do not define this "Being" as the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and studiously avoid using the name of Jesus in their so-called prayers.  Silently (and here intentionally) to omit a confession of the Savior is to deny Him, and be classed as heathen.  (Matt. 18, 17.)  And Christ explicitly teaches that He is the Way, the Life, and the Truth, and that no man cometh unto the Father but by Him.  (John 14, 6.)

_Evolution_. -- The notion is also prevalent that Christianity, revealed religion, "is subject to the laws of evolution."  Aside from the fact that "the laws of evolution" are only imaginings of depraved human nature, which fain would escape just punishment at the hands of God, "progressive Christianity" is simply an absurdity.  What of a Christianity in which the life, teachings, and deeds of a Christ Jesus, little by little, should be superseded by -- what?  Can you think of a moral law which could supersede the Ten Commandments?  Of a just God more righteous than Jehovah?  more loving than Jesus?  more merciful than He who sent His only-begotten Son as the Savior for the whole world?  more merciful than He who embraces the Prodigal (Luke 15, 20), pardons the adulteress (John 8, 11), promises heaven to the thief on the cross (Luke 29, 43), and prayed even for His enemies?

No doubt, it is considered the height of wisdom at the present time to assert that "the law of evolution" also underlies the Christian religion. But what does history tell us concerning those who have come under its spell?  Heathenism is nothing but the result of a trial to improve on the revelation and government of God.  The Babylonian captivity of the Jews and the final dispersement of them over all the earth is the outcome of a similar experiment.  The early Christian Churches in Asia and elsewhere tried their hands at the same thing, and were rewarded by -- Mohammedanism.  And what is popery, Jesuitism, rationalism but the outcome of efforts to apply "the law of evolution" to religion!  Evolution, indeed, but _always_ an evolution downward.

Though the theory on which Darwinian evolution rests has been discarded as insufficient by conscientious scientists, yet the reechoing of it is still heard in some of our higher institutions of learning, not to mention our normal schools, where our common-school teachers are trained.  Hence we often read of this or that "professor," in our daily papers, who adjudges the remains of some prehistoric (?) animal as being so or so many millions of years old.  These opinions finally find their way into text-books and are henceforth promulgated as "gospel truths."  But what reliance may be put upon them the following well-supported facts will show.

1.  The Neanderthal Skull, has, since 1856, been offered as one of the chief proofs for the evolution of man from a lower animal, and has been considered about 300,000 years old.  Dr. Meyer, of Bonn, proved that it is the skull of a Russian Cossack killed in 1814.  

2.  The Calaveras Skull, in the California State Museum, was placed in a mine-shaft, 150 feet deep, as a practical joke.

3.  The "Colorado Specimen" was pronounced by a Columbia College "scientist" to be "the missing link," one million and a half years old.  Cowboys since proved the bones to be that of a pet monkey which they had buried there.

4.  The Croatian Skeletons (Austria) are the bones of degenerate human beings, -- nothing more.

5.  The Pithecanthropus Erectur has for some years (since 1891) been the most popular relic with evolutionists.  The collection consisted of a skull above the eyes, a leg-bone, and two teeth, -- found in Java at separate places.  The age of this "missing link" was guessed by various scientists to be from one hundred thousand to one million years!  According to measurements the skull is that of an idiot.
